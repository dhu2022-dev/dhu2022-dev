## 💭 Outside of work

- I LOVE Hackathons! Me and (sometimes the bois) chugging redbull to pump out a hopelessly unrealistic idea in less than 48 hours: 
- Let's connect! I enjoy meeting new people. I'm in a social fraternity while at college (shout out Phi Sigma Kappa!) and made some of my best friends by taking a risk. Some of my best projects were at other schools done w/ people I hadn't met before. One good way to really know a person is to see how they perform in the middle of the night with only hours to spare. Learned explitives in new langauges then lol.
- I'm fluent in Mandarin to the point where I've worked to edit videos for China's State Television's Education channel (CETV). My grandma did a good job teaching me how not to be a banana. Not a security risk though; proud US citizen and bg check should turn up clean.
- I enjoy portrait photography (though I admit I'm not very good). I share a patent in Portrait Photography. I also help my Dad out at his studio (link coming soon) where he makes money taking portraits as a side hustle outside of work.
- Pretty big on gaming. Select games though: Minecraft (Hypixel Skyblock especially), League of Legends, and Clash of Clans. Fun fact: I moderate TFBlade's channel, a league of legends twitch streamer with 1M+ followers (ask me how I ended up there!) and get paid in Riot Points (RP). I don't type and I just do it mainly during mealtime. My sister says this is negative rizz and the only way I redeem it is to giveaway the RP I've earned to a willing ABG (any takers?!).
- HUGE foodie! Know a good place in your area? Message me! I like trying new things. I also cook at home and college. Favorite dishes to make include: Red Braised Pork (), Black Bean Paste Noodles (), Steak (Medium rare; from the grill w/ mashed potatoes and asparagus. Every guy needs to know). Beverage of choice: Pisco Sour or Suntory Whiskey although I won't say no to Pina Coladas on the beach.
- I also enjoy playing tennis, running, and going to the gym.
- Favorite Movies: The Matrix, Batman: The Dark Knight Rises (Christian Bale = Zamn), Braveheart.
- Favorite Books: Legend of the Condor Heroes, Extreme Ownership, Ranger's Apprentice.
