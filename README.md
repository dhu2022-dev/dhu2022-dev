# 👋 Hi, I'm David Hu

The what is to build a product that matters. The how is with software. The why is a fight everyday to leave behind something with meaning.

## 💭 Outside of Work

### 🧑‍💻 Hackathons & Friends

I LOVE Hackathons! Me and (sometimes the bois) chugging redbull to pump out a hopelessly unrealistic idea in less than 48 hours:

</div>

Let's connect! I enjoy meeting new people. I'm in a social fraternity while at college (proud [PSK](https://phisigmakappa.org/about/) Brother) and made some of my best friends by taking a risk.  
Some of my best projects were at other schools done w/ people I hadn't met before. One good way to really know a person is to see how they perform in the middle of the night with only hours to spare.  
Learned explitives in new languages then lol.

### 🧧 Culture & Language

I'm fluent in Mandarin to the point where I've interned to edit videos for [China State Television's Education channel (CETV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Education_Television).  
My grandma did a good job teaching me how not to be a banana. Not a security risk though; proud US citizen and bg check should turn up clean.

### 📸 Photography

I enjoy portrait photography (though I admit I'm not very good).  
I share a [patent](https://patents.justia.com/patent/11086197) in Portrait Photography. I also help my Dad out at his studio (link coming soon), where he makes money taking portraits as a side hustle outside of work.

### 🎮 Gaming

Pretty big on gaming. Select games though: Minecraft (Hypixel Skyblock especially), League of Legends, and Clash of Clans.  
Fun fact: I moderate [TFBlade's](https://www.twitch.tv/tfblade) channel, a League of Legends Twitch streamer with 1M+ followers (ask me how I ended up there!) and get paid in Riot Points (RP).  
I don't type and I just do it mainly during mealtime. My sister says this is negative rizz and the only way I redeem it is to giveaway the RP I've earned to a willing ABG (any takers?!).

### 🍜 Food & Drinks

HUGE foodie! Know a good place in your area? Message me! I like trying new things. I also cook at home and college.  
Favorite dishes to make include: Red Braised Pork (红烧肉), Black Bean Paste Noodles (炸酱面), Steak (Medium rare; from the grill w/ mashed potatoes and asparagus. Every guy needs to know).  
Beverage of choice: Pisco Sour or Suntory Whiskey although I won't say no to Pina Coladas on the beach.
