# 👋 Hi, I'm David Hu

The what is to build a product that matters. The how is with software. The why is a fight everyday to leave behind something with meaning.

## 💭 Outside of work

- I LOVE Hackathons! Me and (sometimes the bois) chugging redbull to pump out a hopelessly unrealistic idea in less than 48 hours:

![funny gif](readme_images/monkey_computer.gif)

- Let's connect! I enjoy meeting new people. I'm in a social fraternity while at college (proud [PSK](https://phisigmakappa.org/about/) Brother) and made some of my best friends by taking a risk. Some of my best projects were at other schools done w/ people I hadn't met before. One good way to really know a person is to see how they perform in the middle of the night with only hours to spare. Learned explitives in new langauges then lol.

- I'm fluent in Mandarin to the point where I've interned to edit videos for [China State Television's Education channel (CETV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Education_Television). My grandma did a good job teaching me how not to be a banana. Not a security risk though; proud US citizen and bg check should turn up clean.

- I enjoy portrait photography (though I admit I'm not very good). I share a [patent](https://patents.justia.com/patent/11086197) in Portrait Photography. I also help my Dad out at his studio (link coming soon) where he makes money taking portraits as a side hustle outside of work.
<!-- Add photos of the studio, patent paper, and you and Dad together. -->

- Pretty big on gaming. Select games though: Minecraft (Hypixel Skyblock especially), League of Legends, and Clash of Clans. Fun fact: I moderate [TFBlade's](https://www.twitch.tv/tfblade) channel, a league of legends twitch streamer with 1M+ followers (ask me how I ended up there!) and get paid in Riot Points (RP). I don't type and I just do it mainly during mealtime. My sister says this is negative rizz and the only way I redeem it is to giveaway the RP I've earned to a willing ABG (any takers?!).

- HUGE foodie! Know a good place in your area? Message me! I like trying new things. I also cook at home and college. Favorite dishes to make include: Red Braised Pork (红烧肉), Black Bean Paste Noodles (炸酱面), Steak (Medium rare; from the grill w/ mashed potatoes and asparagus. Every guy needs to know). Beverage of choice: Pisco Sour or Suntory Whiskey although I won't say no to Pina Coladas on the beach.
<!-- TODO: Replace pictures of red braised pork, black bean paste noodles, and steak w/ what you made. Also pictures of pisco sour and pina colada. -->

- I also enjoy playing tennis, running, and going to the gym.
